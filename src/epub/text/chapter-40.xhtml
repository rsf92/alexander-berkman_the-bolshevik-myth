<p>
Since my early youth, revolution—social revolution—was 
the great hope and aim of my life. It signified 
to me the Messiah who was to deliver the world from 
brutality, injustice, and evil, and pave the way for a 
regenerated humanity of brotherhood, living in 
peace, liberty, and beauty.
</p>

<p>
Without exaggeration I may say that the happiest 
day of my existence was passed in a prison cell—the 
day when the first news of the October Revolution 
and the victory of the Bolsheviki reached me in the 
Atlanta Federal Penitentiary. The night of my 
dungeon was illumined by the glory of the great 
dream coming true. The bars of steel melted away, 
the stone walls receded, and I trod on the golden 
fleece of the Ideal about to be realised. Then followed 
weeks and months of trepidation, and I lived in a 
ferment of hope and fear—fear lest reaction 
overwhelm the Revolution, hope of reaching the land of promise.
</p>

<p>
At last arrived the longed-for day, and I was in 
Soviet Russia. I came exultant with the Revolution, 
full of admiration for the Bolsheviki, and flushed 
with the joy of useful work awaiting me in the midst 
of the heroic Russian people.
</p>



<p>
I knew that the Bolsheviki were Marxists, believers 
in a centralised State which I, an Anarchist, deny in 
principle. But I placed the Revolution above theories, 
and it seemed to me that the Bolsheviki did the same. 
Though Marxists, they had been instrumental in 
bringing about a revolution that was entirely un-Marxian; 
that was indeed in defiance of Marxian 
dogma and prophecy. Ardent advocates of parliamentarism, 
they repudiated it in their acts. Having 
persistently demanded the convocation of the 
Constituent Assembly, they unceremoniously dissolved 
it when life proved its inadequacy. They 
abandoned their agrarian policy to adopt that of the 
Social Revolutionists, in response to the needs of the 
peasantry. They resolutely applied Anarchist 
methods and tactics when the exigency of the 
situation demanded them. In short, the Bolsheviki 
appeared <em>in practice</em> a thoroughly revolutionary party 
whose sole aim was the success of the Revolution; a 
party possessing the moral courage and integrity to 
subordinate its theories to the common welfare.
</p>

<p>
Had not Lenin himself frequently asserted that 
he and his followers were ultimately Anarchists—that 
political power was to them but a temporary 
means of accomplishing the Revolution? The State 
was gradually to die off, to disappear, as Engels had 
taught, because its functions would become unnecessary and obsolete.
</p>

<p>
I therefore accepted the Bolsheviki as the sincere 
and intrepid vanguard of man's social emancipation. 
To work with them, to help in the fight against the
enemies of the Revolution, to aid in securing its fruits 
to the people was my fervent aspiration.
</p>

<p>
In that state of mind I came to Soviet Russia. As 
I had so passionately avowed at our first meeting 
of welcome on the Russian frontier, I came prepared 
to ignore all theoretic differences of opinion. I came 
to work, not to discuss. To learn, not to teach. To 
learn and to help.
</p>

<p>
I did learn, and I tried to help. I learned day by 
day, through the long weeks and months, in various 
parts of the country. But what I saw and learned 
was in such crying contrast with my hopes and 
expectations as to shake the very foundation of my 
faith in the Bolsheviki. Not that I expected to find 
Russia a proletarian Eldorado. By no means. I knew 
how great the travail of a revolutionary period, how 
stupendous the difficulties to be overcome. Russia 
was besieged on numerous fronts; there was counter-revolution 
within and without; the blockade was 
starving the country and denying even medical aid 
to sick women and children. The people were 
exhausted by long war and civil strife; industry was 
disorganised, the railroads broken down. I fully 
realised the dire situation, with Russia shedding her 
last blood on the altar of the Revolution, while the 
world at large stood by a supine witness and the 
Allied Powers aided death and destruction.
</p>

<p>
I saw the desperate heroism of the people and 
the almost superhuman efforts of the Bolsheviki. 
Closely associated with them, on terms of personal 
friendship with the leading Communists, I shared 
their interests and hopes, helped in their work, and
was inspired by their selfless devotion and entire 
absorption in the service of the Revolution. Lack 
of sympathy on the part of other revolutionary 
elements filled me with grief, even anger. I was 
impatient of criticism of the Bolsheviki at a time 
when they were beset by powerful enemies. Refusal 
of support I resented, condemned as criminal, and I 
exerted my utmost efforts to bring about better 
understanding and cooperation between the opposing revolutionary factions.
</p>

<p>
My closeness to the Bolsheviki, my frank partiality 
in their favor aggravated my friends and 
alienated my nearest comrades. But my faith in 
the Communists and their integrity would not be 
influenced. It was proof even against the evidence 
of my own senses and judgment, of my impressions and experience.
</p>

<p>
Life, reality continuously challenged my faith. I 
saw inequality and injustice on every hand, humanity 
trampled in the dust, alleged exigency made the 
cloak of treachery, deceit, and oppression. I saw 
the ruling Party suppress the vital impulses of the 
Revolution, discourage popular initiative and self-reliance 
so essential to its growth. Yet I clung to 
my faith. Tenaciously I nursed the hope that back 
of the wrong principles and false tactics, back 
of the Government bureaucracy and Party autocracy 
there smoldered the will to idealism that would 
sweep away the black clouds of despotism as soon 
as the Soviet Government would be safe from 
Allied interference and counter-revolution. That 
spark of idealism would excuse to me all the mistakes
and errors, the monstrous incompetency, the 
incredible corruption, even the crimes committed 
in the name of the Revolution.
</p>

<p>
For eighteen months, months of anguish and 
heartrending experience, I clung to that hope. And 
day by day the conviction kept growing that 
Bolshevism was proving fatal to the best interests 
of the Revolution; that political power had become 
the sole aim of the dominant Party; that the State 
with its barrack Communism was enslaving and 
destructive. I saw the Bolsheviki steadily gain 
momentum on the inclined plane of tyranny; the 
Party dictatorship become the irresponsible absolutism 
of a few overlords; the apostles of liberty turn 
executioners of the people.
</p>

<p>
Every day the damning evidence was accumulating. 
I saw the Bolsheviki reflect the Revolution 
as a monstrous grotesque; I saw tragic revolutionary 
necessity institutionalised into irresponsible terror, 
the blood of thousands shed without reason or 
measure. I saw the class struggle, long terminated, 
become a war of vengeance and extermination. I 
saw the ideals of yesterday betrayed, the meaning 
of the Revolution perverted, its essence caricatured 
into reaction. I saw the workers subdued, the 
whole country silenced by the Party dictatorship 
and its organised brutality. I saw entire villages 
laid waste by Bolshevik artillery. I saw the prisons 
filled—not with counter-revolutionists, but with 
workers and peasants, with proletarian intellectuals, 
with starving women and children. I saw the 
revolutionary elements persecuted, the spirit of
October crucified on the Golgotha of the omnipotent Communist State.
</p>

<p>
Still I would not concede the appalling truth. Still 
the hope persisted that the Bolsheviki, though 
absolutely wrong in principle and practice, yet grimly 
held on to some shreds of the revolutionary banner. 
"Allied interference," "the blockade and civil war," 
"the necessity of the transitory stage"—thus I 
sought to placate my outraged conscience. When 
the critical period will be past, the hand of despotism 
and terror would be lifted, and my sorely tried faith justified.
</p>

<p>
At last the fronts were liquidated, civil war ended, 
and the country at peace. But Communist policies 
did not change. On the contrary: more fanatical 
became repression, red terror grew to orgy, more 
ruthlessly the Juggernaut of the State spread death 
and devastation. The country groaned under the 
unbearable yoke of the Party dictatorship. But no 
relief would be given. Then came Kronstadt and 
its simultaneous echoes throughout the land. For 
years the people had suffered untold misery, 
privation, and hunger. For the sake of the Revolution 
they were still willing to bear and to suffer. Not 
for bread did they cry. Only for a breath of life, of liberty.
</p>

<p>
Kronstadt could have easily turned its guns against 
Petrograd and driven out the Bolshevik masters who 
were frightened and on the verge of flight. One 
decisive blow by the sailors, and Petrograd would 
have been theirs and with it Moscow. The entire 
country was ready to welcome the step. Never
before were the Bolsheviki nearer to destruction. 
But Kronstadt, like the rest of Russia, did not intend 
war on the Soviet Republic. It wanted no bloodshed, 
it would not fire the first shot. Kronstadt demanded 
only honest elections, Soviets free from Communist 
domination. It proclaimed the slogans of October 
and revived the true spirit of the Revolution.
</p>

<p>
Kronstadt was crushed as ruthlessly as Thiers 
and Gallifet slaughtered the Paris Communards. 
And with Kronstadt the entire country and its last 
hope. With it also my faith in the Bolsheviki. That 
day I broke finally, irrevocably, with the Communists. 
It became clear to me that never, under any circumtances, 
could I accept that degradation of human 
personality and liberty, that Party chauvinism and 
State absolutism which had become the essence of 
the Communist dictatorship. I realised at last that 
Bolshevik idealism was a <strong>Myth</strong>, a dangerous 
delusion fatal to liberty and progress.
